# Lance Hernandez Portfolio V1.0

## A responsive personal portfolio website designed and coded from scratch.

This personal portfolio will be used as a digital archive and showcase of personal and academic projects. The reasoning for this project is to experiment and delve into web design and development and to act as a foundational website to be continually developed and refined as a student of Bachelor of Computer Science - towards a future into a career in tech.

This project explores the use of HTML, CSS and JS. JavaScript is used to increase responsiveness and allows for pop-ups and dropdown menus.

Refinement, iterative updates and additional features will be documented and deployed. Currently the website is deployed on Netlify but considering to deploy on Hostinger in the future to have a custom domain and for more settings and capabilities.
